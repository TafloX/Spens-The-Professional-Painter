This is my first website development project after completion of my Full stack development course. The transition from mobile to desktop learning has been the most daunting task.
I completed my full stack via Mimo mobile app. Of course they had a desktop version but I didnt have a computer then.
After I got a computer Google and Youtube have been my favourite friends to setup a desktop environment that would simulate the Mimo app.
I downloaded Visual Studio code with a few extensions which im still trying to master. I got to admit that i really need help on this one.
So now since Im a professional painter, I decided to make myself an interactive website that i can have full control over hence the request for help on Javascript aspects like
React, Node, Express, my-sql database, etc.
Im currently recapping on the Full Stack development doing exercises on the PC, but I would love to join the professional version of the course.
In the meantime, Im appealing to developers to help me with design ideas to make a good website. All the information on the template website is true.
Thank you all.
